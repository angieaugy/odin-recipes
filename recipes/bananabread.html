        <h1>Banana Bread</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork to whisk the eggs, and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need. The sugar amount is flexible. The original recipe called for a cup of white sugar, but most people, including me, do just fine with 3/4 cup, and many are happy with 1/2 cup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 medium very ripe bananas, peeled and mashed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
